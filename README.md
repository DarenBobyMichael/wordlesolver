   python word_solver.py

    Suggested starting words: ADIEU, SLATE, or other vowel-rich options.

    Enter Feedback:
    After each guess, input feedback based on the puzzle's response:
        1<letter>: Green (correct position).
        0<letter>: Yellow (present but wrong position).
        <letter>: Black (not in the word).

    Example:
    If you guessed SLATE and received feedback:
        S is correct (green): 1S
        L is present but misplaced (yellow): 0L
        A, T, and E are not in the word (black): A T E
        Enter the feedback as:

Enter output: 1S 0L A T E

Review Suggestions:
The program will display a list of possible words based on your input.

Repeat:
Use the suggestions to make another guess and provide feedback until the word is solved.

Solve and Exit:
Once the puzzle is solved, type:

    SOLVED

    The program will exit with a friendly message.
